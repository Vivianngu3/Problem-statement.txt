## **The Problem**
> Women who are impacted socially and economically by the pandemic have faced increasing accounts of either domestic violence or sexual assault, with limited access to services for help.

## **Description & Solutions**

According to UN statistics, 1 in 3 women are said to be victims of physical or sexual violence, often times by their partners. This instance being higher in low to middle income areas. There's data that can even be seen as unreliable because of the factor that many cases go unreported due to the fear women have to speak up about it. Due to the pandemic, quarantine became a way to protect eachother from the virus but it also granted more freedom to domestic abusers. 


## **Causes**

There are many deeply rooted factors and even problems within itself that cause these violences against women.
