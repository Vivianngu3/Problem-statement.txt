## **The Problem**
> Women who are impacted socially and economically by the pandemic have faced increasing accounts of domestic violence, with limited access to services for help and recovery from trauma.

## **Description**

According to UN statistics, 1 in 3 women are said to be victims of physical or sexual violence at least once since the age of 15, often times by their partners. To be even more percise, an average of 20 people experience domestic violence every minute in the United States. Although that data can even be seen as unreliable because of the factor that many cases go unreported due to the fear women have to speak up about it. In the wave of the pandemic, quarantine became a way to protect eachother from the virus but it also granted more freedom to domestic abusers. Since the start of quarantine, there has been a reported increase of 21-35% of domestic violence cases throughout different states. Harm against another is always  serious 

## **Causes**

There are many deeply rooted factors and even problems within itself that cause these violences against women. Factors such as income, psychiatric morbidity, having history of child abuse, lower levels of education or alcohol abuse, all effect a persons actions and outlook of life or morals.

## **Solutions**
There are efforts and awareness of the problem but these solutions can also lack accessibility in minority or lower income communities. In an article by Wagers, an assistant Professor of Criminology, stated that Nonprofits are getting assistance from the federal CARES act to support domestic violence victims. Other Mental health orgs are also tyring to connect with communities ny issuing suggestions to help. Although these do provide assistance, it would already be too late for the victim. There are many cases where women are so traumatized from the events, they are not able to seek help because of the fear of not being heard. Although there is also Domestic Violence and Crisis hotlines/websites to connect to, the mental impact of going to such measures is difficult to recover yourself from. It is important that there are services that is inclusive of communities and to design empathetically in order to build a safe space for victims.
